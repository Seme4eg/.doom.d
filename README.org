*** Filtering
Each Ibuffer buffer has its *own stack* of active filters. For example, you can
create an Ibuffer buffer displaying only ‘emacs-lisp-mode’ buffers via ‘/ RET
emacs-lisp-mode RET’.

You can also *combine* filters. For example, suppose you only want to see buffers
in ‘emacs-lisp-mode’, whose names begin with "gnus":

: / RET emacs-lisp-mode RET
: / n ^gnus RET

Additionally, you can *OR* the top two filters together with ~/ |~ (*AND* with ~/ &~)

Filters can also be saved and restored using mnemonic names: see the
functions ‘ibuffer-save-filters’ and ‘ibuffer-switch-to-saved-filters’.

*** Filter Groups
A filter group is basically a named group of buffers which
match a filter, which are displayed together in an Ibuffer buffer.

Just like filters themselves, filter *groups act as a stack*. The first filter
group is used. The filter groups are displayed in this order of *precedence*.

You may *rearrange* filter groups by using the usual pair ‘C-k’ and ‘C-y’. Yanked
groups will be inserted before the group at point.

** Info [[file:~/.config/emacs/.local/straight/repos/evil-collection/modes/info/evil-collection-info.el][evil-collection-info.el]] [[elisp:(helpful-variable 'Info-mode-map)][Info-mode-map]]
#+begin_comment
Info files are created from Texinfo source files. You can use the same source
file to make a printed manual or produce other formats, such as HTML and
DocBook.

The ‘makeinfo’ command converts a Texinfo file into an Info file;
‘texinfo-format-region’ and ‘texinfo-format-buffer’ are GNU Emacs functions that
do the same.

~SPC h i~ (info) - Enter Info, the documentation browser. _Numeric prefix_ to this
command switches / creates Info buffer with that number. (They r *independent*)

~M-h~ (Info-help) - Enter the Info tutorial.

_Basics:_
- ~g k/j~ or ~C-k/j~ (Info-prev/next) - Go to the "previous/next" node, but C-k/j
  also counts nesting.
- ~g [ / ]~ or ~TAB / S-TAB~ (Info-prev/next-reference) - Move cursor to the
  previous/next cross-reference (link)
- ~g m~ (Info-menu) - Go to the node pointed to by the menu item.
- ~u~ (Info-up) - Go to the superior node of this node.
- ~C-o/t~ (Info-history-back) - Go back in the history
- ~TAB~ (Info-history-forward) - Go forward in the history (_doesn't work_)
- ~i~ (*Info-index*) - You can get to the index from the main menu of the file with
  the ‘m’ command and the name of the index node; then you can use the ‘m’
  command again in the index node to go to the node that describes the topic you
  want. ~i~ is just a short-cut, which does all of that for u. It searches the
  index for a given topic (a string) and goes to the node which is listed in the
  index for that topic. *Very powerful command, lets u get info on any
  'mode'-related thing*.
- ~I~ (Info-virtual-index) - behaves like ‘i’, but constructs a virtual info node
  displaying the results of an index search, making it easier to select the one
  you want.
- ~g L~ (Info-history) - Go to a node with a menu of visited nodes.
- ~d~ (Info-directory) - Go to the Info directory node. Which is the first one you
  saw when you entered Info, has a menu which leads (directly or indirectly,
  through other menus)
- ~g t~ (Info-top-node) - command moves to the ‘Top’ node of the *manual*.
- ~g T~ (Info-toc) - Go to a node with table of contents of the c...

_Advanced:_
- ~a~ (info-apropos) - If you aren’t sure which manual documents the topic you are
  looking for. It prompts for a string and then looks up that string in *all* the
  indices of *all* the Info documents installed on your system.
- ~g G~ (Info-goto-node) - If you know a node’s name, you can go there using this
  command. ~gTop<RET>~ is same as ~g t~ (info-top-node).
- ~g 1..9~ (Info-nth-menu-item) - Go to the node of the Nth menu item. They are
  short for the ‘m’ command together with a name of a menu subtopic.
- ~M-n~ (clone-buffer) - creates a new *independent* Info buffer. The new buffer
  starts out as an exact copy of the old one, but you will be able to move
  independently between nodes in the two buffers.

To look up Info-mode _variables_ go ~SPC h i~ -> ~g m~ -> Info -> ~g G Variables~

- ~f~ :: following cross reference (part 1.7 of ~M-h~)
- f? :: list all references in cur. node

** Embark [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark/wiki/Default-Actions][#default-actions]] [[file:~/.config/emacs/.local/straight/repos/evil-collection/modes/embark/evil-collection-embark.el][evil-collection-embark.el]]
Thing that allows u to:
- Visit a package’s URL from the minibuffer (~C-h p {package}~ -> ~spc ; u~)
- Add a keybinding for a command name from anywhere it appears: ~spc a~ on
  =dired-jump= -> l (set local kbd (globally is also there))
- Working with sets of possible targets (~collect~ / ~export~)
  - Prefer ‘embark-export’ since when an exporter to a special major mode is
    available for a given type of target, it will be more featureful than an
    Embark collect buffer, and if no such exporter is configured the
    ‘embark-export’ command falls back to the generic ‘embark-collect-snapshot’.
  - Export buffer candidates to ibuffer (~spc ,~ -> ~spc ; E~), same with files &
    variables.
  - Export grep or line candidates to a grep buffer: ~{any seach cmd}~ ->
    =embark-export= (~E~) -> ~C-c C-f~ to turn on 'follow on point'

*** Acting on targets
Offering relevant _actions_ to use on a _target_ determined by the context:
- In the *minibuffer*, the target is the current top completion candidate.
- In the *Completions* buffer the target is the completion at point.
- In a *regular buffer*, the target is the region if active, or else the file,
  symbol, URL, s-expression or defun at point.

Multiple *targets* can be present at the same location and you can *cycle* between
them by repeating the ‘embark-act’ key binding.

Embark behaviors are configurable via the variable =embark-indicators=. Instead
of selecting an action via its key binding, you can select it by name with
completion by typing ‘C-h’ after ‘embark-act’.

*Configuring* which actions are offered for a *type*: =embark-keymap-alist=
associates target types with variables containing keymaps, and those keymaps
containing bindings for the actions.

#+NAME: For example
#+begin_comment
In the default configuration the type ‘file’ is associated with the symbol
‘embark-file-map’. That symbol names a keymap with single-letter key bindings
for common Emacs file commands, for instance ‘c’ is bound to ‘copy-file’. This
means that if you are in the minibuffer after running a command that prompts for
a file, such as ‘find-file’ or ‘rename-file’, you can copy a file by running
‘embark-act’ and then pressing ‘c’.
#+end_comment

These action keymaps are very convenient but not strictly necessary when using
‘embark-act’: you can use any command that reads from the minibuffer as an
action and the target of the action will be inserted at the first minibuffer
prompt. After running ‘embark-act’ all of your key bindings and even
=‘execute-extended-command’= can be used to run a command. _For example_, if you
want to replace all occurrences of the symbol at point, just use ‘M-%’ as the
action, there is no need to bind ‘query-replace’ in one of Embark’s keymaps.

The *actions* in =embark-general-map= are available always. By *default* this includes
*bindings* to save the current candidate in the kill ring and to insert the
current candidate in the target buffer.

Emacs commands often do not set useful category metadata so the Marginalia
(https://github.com/minad/marginalia) package, which supplies this missing
metadata, is highly recommended for use with Embark.

~embark-act RET~ usually runs the *default* action on target (in minibuffer - first
candidate, in buffer - default action bound to 'RET' keymap (like /browse-url/ on
links))

~embark-dwim~ runs *default* action for 1st target found (handy in non-minibuffers).
Default behaviour is:
- Open the file at point.
- Open the URL at point in a web browser (using the ‘browse-url’ command).
- Compose a new email to the email address at point.
- In an Emacs Lisp buffer, if point is on an opening parenthesis or right after
  a closing one, it will evaluate the corresponding expression.
- Go to the definition of an Emacs Lisp function, variable or macro at point.
- Find the file corresponding to an Emacs Lisp library at point.

In *Embark Actions* buffer (embark's /Which-key/) you can scroll that buffer with
_usual_ ~C-M-(S-)v~ - =scroll-other-window(-down)=

By default Doom uses =embark-which-key-indicator=, but embark comes with its own
indicators, which u can look up in embark's /Info -> 3.1 Showing ../

~C-h~ =embark-help-key= (after =embark-act=) - will prompt you for the name of an
action with completion (but feel free to enter a command that is not among the
offered candidates!). You can press ‘embark-keymap-prompter-key’, which is ‘@’
by default, at the prompt and then one of the key bindings to enter the name of
the corresponding action.

*** Switching command without losing input | ~embark-become~
~B~ =embark-become= - change current command keeping your input (like
/switch-to-buffer/ -> /find-file/)
