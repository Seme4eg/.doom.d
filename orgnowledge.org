* Document Structure [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Document-Structure.html#Document-Structure][#docs]]
** Initial visibility

When Emacs first visits an Org file, the global state is set to showeverything.
This can be configured through the variable org-startup-folded, or on a per-file
basis by adding one of the following lines anywhere in the buffer:

Possible =#+STARTUP= values:
- overview
- content
- showall
- show2levels / show3levels / show4levels / show5levels
- showeverything

Furthermore, any entries with a ‘VISIBILITY’ property (see Properties and
Columns) get their visibility adapted accordingly. Allowed values for this
property are ‘folded’, ‘children’, ‘content’, and ‘all’.
** Motion

~SPC m . / SPC m g g~ - Jump to an Org heading.

- g H       - evil-org-top
- g h       - org-up-element
- g k/j     - org-backward(forward)-element
- g s h     - org/goto-visible heading with avy
- SPC m g v - org/goto-visible

With [ / ] prefix:
- c - org-babel-previous(next)-src-block
- l - org-previous(next)-link
- h - org-backward(forward)-heading-same-level

** Structure Editing

- ~C-RET~ / ~C-S-RET~ - insert new heading below / above same level and enter *insert*
  mode
- ~M-RET~ - insert new heading same level and remain in *normal* mode
- ~C-M-RET~  org-insert-subheading
- ~M-S-RET~ - Insert a new TODO heading with the same level
- ~M-h/l~ - promote / demote heading

*Tree/subtree* prefix ~SPC m s~ ↓
- h - promote subtree
- l - demote subtree
- k - move subtree up
- j - move subtree down
- d - cut subtree
- r - refile subtree (instead of copy / paste commands)
- S - sort same-level entries
- n - narrow to subtree
- N - widen (to remove narrowing)

~SPC m */h~ - toggle heading (heading -> text / text -> heading)

** Sparse Trees

Construct sparse trees for selected information in an outline tree, so that the
entire document is folded as much as possible, but the selected information is
made visible along with the headline structure above it.

~SPC m s s~ / ~C-c /~ (org-sparse-tree) - Create a sparse tree, prompt for the
details. To get back to normal tree view - 2x =TAB=.

The syntax for the search string is described in [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Matching-tags-and-properties.html][Matching tags and properties]].

** Lists

- /Unordered/ list items start with ‘-’, ‘+’, or ‘*’ as bullets.
- /Ordered/ list items start with a numeral followed by either a period or a right
  parenthesis, such as ‘1.’
- /Description/ list items are unordered list items, and contain the separator
  ‘::’ to distinguish the description term from the description.

To update type of a list or just rerender it cuz u changed anything - ~C-c C-c~

~SPC m i~ - org-toggle-item

Lists have same kbds as [[Structure Editing][headers]] (for creating new / de/pro-moting..)

- ~TAB~ on item to hide it just like normal heading:
  - nested entry
- ~C-S-h/l~ (org-shift[direction]) - *change bullet style*

~C-c ^~ - Sort the plain list. Prompt for the sorting method: numerically,
alphabetically, by time, or by custom function.

** Drawers

Sometimes you want to keep information associated with an entry, but you
normally do not want to see it. For this, Org mode has drawers. They can contain
anything but a headline and another drawer.

~C-c C-x d~ - insert drawer at point. With an active region, this command puts the
region inside the drawer.

:test-drawer:
This text is inside the drawer
:END:

With a prefix argument, this command calls org-insert-property-drawer, which
creates a ‘PROPERTIES’ drawer right below the current headline. Org mode uses
this special drawer for storing properties (see Properties and Columns). You
cannot use it for anything else.

You can also arrange for state change notes (see Tracking TODO state changes)
and clock times (see Clocking Work Time) to be stored in a ‘LOGBOOK’ drawer. If
you want to store a quick note there, in a similar way to state changes, use:

~C-c C-z~ - Add a time-stamped note to the ‘LOGBOOK’ drawer.

** Blocks

Org mode uses ‘#+BEGIN’ … ‘#+END’ blocks for various purposes from including
source code examples (see Literal Examples) to capturing time logging
information (see Clocking Work Time).

You can also get all blocks folded at startup by configuring the variable org-hide-block-startup or on a per-file basis by using

: #+STARTUP: (no)hideblocks

_Formatted blocks of text_ (expand with ~tab~ and edit with ~SPC m '~ / ~C-c '~):
- ~<e~ - /example/ block into which you can type text that you don't want org to
  mess with like a [[link]]
- ~<q~ - /quotation/
- ~<c~ - /centred/ text (only after it is exported tho 🙁)

*** Executing source code blocks
Org-mode can execute your source code blocks and add the output to
your file. This part of org-mode is called babel

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  echo "Hello $USER! Today is `date`"
  exit
#+END_SRC

> text below is executed via ~C-c C-c~, while cursor on block above

#+RESULTS:
: Hello sad! Today is Пт авг 16 15:00:47 MSK 2019

*** Source code blocks

After 'python' keyword on line below you can write the output of the
code to a var and use it in next code-block
#+NAME: pythonic-numbers
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results list
  import random
  return [random.randrange(1, 20)
          for i in range( random.randrange(1, 20))]
#+END_SRC

after u execute this (~C-c C-c~) the output will appear below and
'pythonic-numbers' will contain value

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var numbers=pythonic-numbers
  (length numbers)
#+END_SRC

* Hyperlinks [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Hyperlinks.html#Hyperlinks][#docs]]

Open links just with ~RET~

~SPC m l~ prefix:
- l org-insert-link
- c org-cliplink - Takes a URL from the clipboard and inserts an
  org-mode link with the title of a page found by the URL into the current
  buffer
- L org-insert-all-links
- S org-insert-last-stored-link

- i org-id-store-link
- s org-store-link
- d +org/remove-link (at point)
- t *org-toggle-link-display*

[[http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/org-mode-basics-iii-add-links-and-images-to-you-notes/][how to paste local img/gifs into document]]

z i      org-toggle-inline-images

~spc n l~ (org-store-link) - store link (If the headline has a ‘CUSTOM_ID’
property, store a link to this custom ID) to be able to choose it later from the
~spc m l l~ popup menu

** Internal Links

A link that does not look like a URL—i.e., does not start with a known scheme or
a file name—refers to the current document.

#+begin_example
Org provides several refinements to internal navigation within a document. Most
notably, a construct like ‘[[#my-custom-id]]’ specifically targets the entry
with the ‘CUSTOM_ID’ property set to ‘my-custom-id’. Also, an internal link
looking like ‘[[*Some section]]’ points to a headline with the name ‘Some
section’
#+end_example

When the link does not belong to any of the cases above, Org looks for a dedicated target: the same string in double angular brackets, like ‘<<My Target>>’.

: [[my target]] - link to 'my target' above

If no dedicated target exists, the link will then try to match the exact name of
an element within the buffer. Naming is done with the #+NAME keyword:

#+NAME: some name
content here

: [[some name]] - link to content with #id

During export, internal links are used to mark objects and assign them a number.
Marked objects are then referenced by links pointing to them. In particular,
links without a description appear as the number assigned to the marked
object26. In the following excerpt from an Org buffer

1. one item
2. <<target>>another item
Here we refer to item [[target]].

The last sentence will appear as ‘Here we refer to item 2’ when exported.
** Radio Targets

Org can automatically turn any occurrences of certain target names in normal
text into a link. So without explicitly creating a link, the text connects to
the target radioing its position. Radio targets are enclosed by triple angular
brackets. For example, a target ‘<<<My Target>>>’ causes each occurrence of ‘my
target’ in normal text to become activated as a link. The Org file is scanned
automatically for radio targets only when the file is first loaded into Emacs.
To update the target list during editing, press ~C-c C-c~ with point on or at a
target.

** External Links

Just some examples (there r much more types of external links in org):

~spc m l l~ -> /file:/ -> link to a file

Elisp link (any elisp code or available emacs command):

: [[elisp:org-agenda][My org agenda]]

** Search Options in File Links

: [[file:~/code/main.c::255]] - jump to line 255
: [[file:~/xx.org::My Target]] - Search for a link target ‘<<My Target>>’
: [[file:~/xx.org::*My Target]] - restrict search to headlines
: [[file:~/xx.org::#my-custom-id]] - link to headingi wtih 'CUSTOM_ID' prop.
: [[file:~/xx.org::/regexp/]]

* /TODO Items [[https://orgmode.org/manual/TODO-Items.html#TODO-Items][#docs]]
** Basic TODO functionality
- SPC m t (org-todo)                 - display all statuses possible
- ~C-S-h/l/k/j~ (org-shift[direction]) - *change heading status / priority*
- SPC m T / SPC n t (org-todo-list)  - show the global TODO list
- <M-S-return> (org-insert-todo-heading)

** /TODO Extensions
Setting up keywords for individual files:

: #+TODO: TODO FEEDBACK VERIFY | DONE CANCELED
: #+TYP_TODO: Fred Sara Lucy Mike | DONE

or a setup for using several sets in parallel:

: #+TODO: TODO(t) | DONE(d)
: #+TODO: REPORT(r) BUG(b) KNOWNCAUSE(k) | FIXED(f)
: #+TODO: | CANCELED(c)

** /TODO Dependencies

If an entry has a property ‘ORDERED’, each of its TODO children is blocked until
all earlier siblings are marked as done. Here is an example:

: * Parent
: :PROPERTIES:
: :ORDERED:  t
: :END:
: ** TODO a
: ** TODO b, needs to wait for (a)
: ** TODO c, needs to wait for (a) and (b)

You can ensure an entry is never blocked by using the ‘NOBLOCKING’ property
** Progress Logging
_Closing items_:

The most basic automatic logging is to keep track of when a certain TODO item
was marked as done: =(setq org-log-done 'time)=

If you want to record a note along with the timestamp: =(setq org-log-done 'note)=

The corresponding in-buffer settings are: =‘#+STARTUP: logdone’= & =‘#+STARTUP:
lognotedone’=

_Tracking TODO state changes_:

Since it is normally too much to record a note for every state, Org mode expects
configuration on a per-keyword basis for this. This is achieved by adding
special markers ‘!’ (for a timestamp) or ‘@’ (for a note with timestamp) in
parentheses after each keyword. For example, with the setting:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-todo-keywords
      '((sequence "TODO(t)" "WAIT(w@/!)" "|" "DONE(d!)" "CANCELED(c@)")))
#+end_src

You can use the exact same syntax for setting logging preferences local to a
buffer:

: #+TODO: TODO(t) WAIT(w@/!) | DONE(d!) CANCELED(c@)

In order to define logging settings that are local to a subtree or a single
item, define a ‘LOGGING’ property in this entry:

: * TODO Only log when switching to WAIT, and when repeating
  : :PROPERTIES:
  : :LOGGING: WAIT(@) logrepeat
  : :END:

[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Tracking-your-habits.html][Tracking your habits]]
** Checkboxes (todo list)

Checklists [0/4] [0%]:
- [ ] M-S-RET new checkbox item
- [ ] ~RET~ - =dwim= command - /do what i mean/, which in this case toggles state of a
  TODO entry
- [ ] while ~C-c C-c~ / ~spc m x~ will just check/uncheck it
  - [ ] sub item
- [ ] track the number of items by adding ~[/]~ or [0%] to the end of a line above
  a checklist (and then press ~C-c C-c~) - this updates when you check items off.

~C-c C-*~ - Turn the whole plain list into a subtree of the current heading.
Checkboxes (see Checkboxes) become ‘TODO’, respectively ‘DONE’, keywords when
unchecked, respectively checked.

* Tags [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Tags.html#Tags][#docs]] :tags:example:

Every headline can contain a list of tags; they occur at the end of the
headline. Tags are normal words containing letters, numbers, ‘_’, and ‘@’.

Important note: u *cannot* search tags in project, those r per-file

Tags can be attached to any headline. Each headline can have multiple tags. Tags
r inheritant (all nested headings also have their parents' tag, but it doesn't
show)

- ~SPC m q~ (org-set-tags-command) - Set the tags for the current visible entry.
- ~SPC n m~ / ~SPC o a m~ (org-tags-view) - Show all headlines for all
  ‘org-agenda-files’ matching tag
- ~SPC m s a~ (org-toggle-archive-tag) - Toggle the archive tag for the current headline.

~SPC m s s~ -> m - use sparse tree to show only those headings matching given tag.

You can also set tags that all entries in a file should inherit just as if these
tags were defined in a hypothetical level zero that surrounds the entire file:

: #+FILETAGS: :Peter:Boss:Secret:

~C-c C-x q~ - org-toggle-tags-groups (dunno what exactly it does tho 🤔)

Also check [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Setting-Tags.html][fast tag selection]]

* Properties .. [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Properties-and-Columns.html#Properties-and-Columns][#docs]]
:PROPERTIES:
:Title:    Goldberg Variations
:Composer: J.S. Bach
:Artist:   Glenn Gould
:Publisher: Deutsche Grammophon
:NDisks:   1
:END:

- SPC m o   - org-set-property
- ~C-c C-c~ (org-property-action) - With point in a property drawer, this executes
  property commands.
  - ~c~ (org-compute-property-at-point) Compute the property at point, using
    the operator and scope from the nearest column format definition.

You may define the allowed values for a particular property ‘Xyz’ by setting a
property ‘Xyz_ALL’. This special property is inherited, so if you set it in a
level 1 entry, it applies to the entire tree:

: :PROPERTIES:
: :NDisks_ALL:  1 2 3 4
: :Publisher_ALL: "Deutsche Grammophon" Philips EMI
: :END:

Properties can be inserted on buffer level. That means they apply before the
first headline and can be inherited by all entries in a file. Property blocks
defined before first headline needs to be located at the top of the buffer,
allowing only comments above.

Properties can also be defined using lines like:

: #+PROPERTY: NDisks_ALL 1 2 3 4

[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Special-Properties.html][Special Properties]] - provide an alternative access method to Org mode features,
like the TODO state or the priority of an entry, discussed in the previous
chapters. This interface exists so that you can include these states in a column
view (see Column View), or to use them in queries.

~C-c / p~ - Create a sparse tree based on the value of a property. If you enclose
the value in curly braces, it is interpreted as a regular expression and matched
against the property values.

_Property Inheritance_:

Org mode has a few properties for which inheritance is hard-coded:
- COLUMNS
- CATEGORY
- ARCHIVE
- LOGGING

* .. and Columns [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Column-View.html#Column-View][#docs]]
:PROPERTIES:
:COLUMNS:  %25ITEM %TAGS %PRIORITY %TODO
:END:

Properties can be conveniently edited and viewed in column view.

Setting up a column view first requires defining the columns. This is done by
defining a column format line.

To specify a format that only applies to a specific tree, add a ‘COLUMNS’
property to the top node of that tree.

A ‘COLUMNS’ property within a property drawer before first headline will apply
to the entire file. As an addition to property drawers, keywords can also be
defined for an entire file using a line like:

: #+COLUMNS: %25ITEM %TAGS %PRIORITY %TODO

[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Column-attributes.html][Column attributes]]

_Using column view:_

- C-c C-x C-c (org-columns) - Turn on column view.
- ~r~ / ~g~ on a columns view line (org-columns-redo) - Recreate the column view, to
  include recent changes made in the buffer.
- ~C-c C-c~ or ~q~ on a columns view line (org-columns-quit) - Exit column view.

_Editing values_:

Use evil keys to move through the column view from field to field.

- 1..9,0 - Directly select the Nth allowed value, 0 selects the 10th value.
- n/p - Switch to the next/previous allowed value of the field.
- e - Edit the property at point.
- v - View the full value of this property.
- a (org-columns-edit-allowed) - Edit the list of allowed values for this
property.

_Modifying column view on-the-fly_:

- </> (org-columns-narrow/widen) Make the column narrower/wider by one character.
- S-M-RIGHT/LEFT (org-columns-new/delete) - Insert a new column, to the left of
  the current column / Delete the current column.

* Dates and Times
** Creating Timestamps

[2021-11-09 Вт] - Inactive timestamp. Just like a plain timestamp, but with
square brackets instead of angular ones. These timestamps are inactive in the
sense that they do not trigger an entry to show up in the agenda.

- SPC m d t / C-c . (org-time-stamp)    - Prompt for a date/time and insert a ti...
- SPC m d T (org-time-stamp-inactive)   - Insert an inactive time stamp.
- SPC m c -/= (org-clock-timestamps-down/up) - In[de]crease CLOCK timestamps at
  cursor. On the beginning or enclosing bracket of a timestamp, change its type.
  Within a timestamp, change the item under point.
- C-c . (org-time-stamp)                - Prompt for a date/time and insert a ti...
- C-c C-c - Normalize timestamp, insert or fix day name if missing or wrong.
- C-c < (org-date-from-calendar) - Insert a timestamp corresponding to point
  date in the calendar.
- C-c > (org-goto-calendar) Access the Emacs calendar for the current date. If
  there is a timestamp in the current line, go to the corresponding date
  instead.

~C-c C-x C-t~ (org-toggle-time-stamp-overlays) - Toggle the use of custom time
stamp formats.

** Deadline and Scheduling
DEADLINE: <2021-12-09 Чт>
SCHEDULED: <2004-12-25 Sat>

Warning period of 5 days example: ‘DEADLINE: <2004-02-29 Sun -5d>’

SCHEDULED - Meaning: you are planning to start working on that task on the given
date.

** Clocking commands
:PROPERTIES:
:Effort:   0:30
:END:
:LOGBOOK:
CLOCK: [2021-12-07 Вт 01:50]--[2021-11-07 Вс 01:54] => -719:56
CLOCK: [2021-11-07 Вс 01:49]--[2021-11-07 Вс 01:50] =>  0:01
CLOCK: [2021-11-07 Вс 01:48]--[2021-11-07 Вс 01:49] =>  0:01
:END:

~SPC m c~ prefix:
- i (org-clock-in) - *start* the clock onthe current item
- o (org-clock-out) - *stop* the currently running clock.
- I (org-clock-in-last) - *re-clock* in the last closed clocked item.
- c / spc n C (org-clock-cancel) - *cancel* the running clock.
- g / SPC n o (org-clock-goto) - *go to* the current clock, or to the most recent.
- l / SPC n c (+org/toggle-last-clock) - *toggle last* clocked item.
- r (org-resolve-clocks) - *resolve all* currently open Org clocks.

Don't see much usage:
- d - org-clock-mark-default-task
- =/- - Increase / decrease CLOCK timestamps at cursor.

C-c C-x C-d (org-clock-display) - Display time summaries for each subtree in the
current buffer. This puts overlays at the end of each headline, showing the
total time recorded under that heading, including the time of any subheadings.

[[https://orgmode.org/manual/The-clock-table.html][The clock table]]: SPC m c R (org-clock-report) - insert / update clock table.

[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Effort-Estimates.html][Effort Estimates]]:
- SPC m c e - update effort estimate for cur. clock
- SPC m c E - org-set-effort
- C-c C-x E - org-inc-effort

** Relative / Countdown Timer

Once started, relative and countdown timers are controlled with the same
commands.

~C-c C-x~ prefix ↓
- 0 - org-timer-start - Start or reset the relative timer
- ; - org-timer-set-timer - Start a countdown timer
- . - org-timer - Insert a relative time into the buffer. The first time you use
  this, the timer starts. Using a prefix argument restarts it.
- , - org-timer-pause-or-continue
- - org-timer-item - Insert a description list item with the current relative
  time. With a prefix argument, first reset the timer to 0.
- _ - org-timer-stop

M-RET (org-insert-heading) - Once the timer list is started, this command will
insert new timer items.

* Refile and copy [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Refile-and-Copy.html][#docs]]
When reviewing the captured data, you may want to refile or to copy some of the
entries into a different list, for example into a project. Cutting, finding the
right location, and then pasting the note is cumbersome. To simplify this
process, you can use =refile=.

SPC m r/s r (org-refile) - Move the entry or entries at point to another hea...

Refile current heading (~SPC m r~ prefix) .. :
- v (+org/refile-to-visible)       - .. as first child of visible heading
- O (+org/refile-to-other-buffer)
- o (+org/refile-to-other-window)
- f (+org/refile-to-file)          - .. to a particular org file.
- l (+org/refile-to-last-location) - .. to the last node you refiled
- c (+org/refile-to-running-clock)
- . (+org/refile-to-current-file)

~SPC m g r~ (org-refile-goto-last-stored) - Jump to the location where org-refile
last moved a tree to.

C-c M-w (org-refile-copy) Copying works like refiling, except that the original
note is not deleted.

* Archiving

When a project represented by a (sub)tree is finished, you may want to move the
tree out of the way and to stop it from contributing to the agenda. Archiving is
important to keep your working files compact and global searches like the
construction of agenda views fast.

~SPC m A~ (org-archive-subtree) - Move the current subtree to the archive. The
archive can be a certain top-level heading in the current file, or in a
different file.  The tree will be moved to that location, the subtree heading be
marked DONE, and the current time will be added.

_Internal archiving_:

~SPC m s a~ (org-toggle-archive-tag) - Toggle the archive tag for the current
headline.
* Capture and Attachments
** Capture
~SPC X~ / ~SPC n n~ (org-capture) - Display the capture templates menu.

~SPC n N~ (org-capture-goto-target) - Go to the target location of a capture
template. If TEMPLATE-KEY param is nil, the user is queried for the template.

~SPC m g x~ (org-capture-goto-last-stored)

# check
# Edited ~org-capture-templates~ so all new tasks will be today's date by
# default.
# ~Shift + arrows~ - edit date

[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Capture-templates.html][Capture templates]] - what i've done in my config.el file.

** Attachments
=org-attach-directory= - Customize where attachments will be downloaded. You can
set this value per-file with =# -*- org-attach-directory: "~/some/path/"; -*-=
