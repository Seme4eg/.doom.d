#+TITLE: Telega

* Telega [[https://zevlg.github.io/telega.el/][#docs]] [[file:~/.config/emacs/.local/straight/repos/evil-collection/modes/telega/evil-collection-telega.el][evil-collection-telega.el]]
_Chat Filters_ (~\/~ prefix) are used to match chats, same as regexps are used to
match strings. Chat Filters uses S-exp notation similar to rx package for
regexps. Consider Chat Filters as extremely powerful "Folders" functionality in
official client.

_Sorting Chats_, ~\\~ prefix

[[elisp:(helpful-variable 'telega-prefix-map)][telega-prefix-map]] (~C-c t~ in my case) & ~g a~ prefix:

S (telega-msg-save) Save messagesâ€™s MSG media content to a file.

_Chat folders, ~g O~ prefix_:
- commands: ~create/delete/reorder/rename/add/remove~
- =telega-root-view-topics-folders= - Non-nil to add Chat Folders to the list of
  topics. Could be one of prepend, append or nil. (Default value: append)
- =telega-folder-icons-alist= - Alist of symbols to be used as folder icons
  instead of telega-symbol-folder. See list of all available icon names in
  =telega-folder-icon-names=.

** Rootbuf fast navigation (~J~)
- J u (telega-root-next-unread) Move point to the next chat with unread message.
- J i (telega-root-next-important) Move point to the next chat with important
  messages. Important message is a message matching "Important" custom chat
  filter. If there is no "Important" custom chat filter, then (or mention (and
  unread unmuted)) chat filter is used.
- J @, J m (telega-root-next-mention) Move point to the next chat with mention.

** Rootbuf view switching (~g V~)
~g~ prefix in rootbuf is used to switch root views:

- s, V s (telega-view-search) View QUERY search results.
- V n (telega-view-nearby) View contacts and chats nearby telega-my-location.
- V v (telega-view-reset) Reset rootview to the default value.
- V 0 (telega-view-compact) Compact view for the rootbuf.

- V t (telega-view-topics) Group chats by telega-root-view-topics. (also view
  /customizable options/ for 'topics')
- V F (telega-view-files) View status of files known to telega. File can be in
  one of the state kinds: "downloading", "uploading", "partially-downloaded",
  "partially-uploaded", "downloaded". If C-u is specified, then query user about
  file state kinds to show. By default all kinds are shown.

If you use this view frequently, consider setting
telega-chat-upload-attaches-ahead to nil, to avoid file duplications for
"uploading" kind. See
https://github.com/tdlib/td/issues/1348#issuecomment-752654650 for details

Press ~d~ under downloaded filename to delete the file. Only files cached by TDLib
in the telega-cache-dir can be deleted.

  telega-root-view-top-categories) List of top categories with limits.

use next: ~(setq telega-chat-show-deleted-messages-for '(not saved-messages))~

*** Scheduling messages and reminders
C-c C-a scheduled RET, select date and time to schedule message at, type text of
a message and send it as always.

Message scheduled in "Saved Messages" chat is called _reminder_.

Whenever a scheduled message or reminder is sent, you get a special notification
marked with a ðŸ“…, so you don't get caught off-guard by messages you planned in
the past.

*** Navigating previous input
You can navigate your previous chatbuf input using commands:
- ~M-p~ (=telega-chatbuf-edit-prev=) Edit previously sent message. If C-u is given,
  then just copy last sent message.
- ~M-n~ (=telega-chatbuf-edit-next=) Edit message sent next to currently editing. If
  WITHOUT-AUX is specified with C-u, then instead of editing, just pop
  previously sent message as input.
- ~M-r~ (=telega-chatbuf-input-search=) Search for REGEX in chat input history.

While _searching input_, you can use M-p (telega-chatbuf--input-search-input-prev)
and M-n (telega-chatbuf--input-search-input-next) to cycle chatbuf input ring.

*** Sending messages via bots
If chatbuf input starts with @<botname> <query> and mentioned bot support inline
mode, then pressing TAB (telega-chatbuf-complete-or-next-link) will pop a
special buffer with the inline results to the bot inline <query>, you can use
these results to send a message via bot. Some useful bots with inline mode
support are:

- @gif To search and send animations
- @pic, @bing To search and send pictures
- @vid To search and send videos on YouTube
- @foursquare - To find and send places around the world
- etc

To find out is some bot supports inline mode or not, enter @<botname><SPC> in
chatbuf input and press TAB (telega-chatbuf-complete-or-next-link). If momentary
help is displayed, then this bot supports inline mode.

Customizable options for inline bots:
- =telega-known-inline-bots= - List of known bots for everyday use. (Default
  value: ("@gif" "@youtube" "@pic"))
- =telega-inline-query-window-select= - Non-nil to select window with inline
  query results. (Default value: t)

*** Filtering chat messages a.k.a. Shared Media
Message filtering means to show only some messages matching filter. Available

url, doc, file, gif, audio, video, voice-note, video-note, voice-video-note,
chat-photo, call, missed-call, mention, unread-mention, failed-to-send, pinned.

Chatbuf uses next _bindings_ for message filtering:
- ~C-c /~ (telega-chatbuf-filter) Enable chat message filtering MSG-FILTER.
- ~_~, ~C-c C-c~ (telega-chatbuf-filter-cancel) Cancel any message filtering. If point
  is at some message, then keep point on this message after reseting.
- ~C-c C-r/s~ (telega-chatbuf-filter-search) Interactively search for
  messages in chatbuf. If C-u is given, then search for QUERY sent by some chat
  member, member name is queried.

*** Opening files using external programs
Document messages in Telegram has attached file in the message. You can use
=org-open-file= function for this. Behaviour is controlled by:

=telega-open-file-function= - Function to use to open files associated with
messages. Called with single argument - filename to open. Could be used to open
files in external programs. Set it to org-open-file to use Org mode to open
files. (Default value: find-file)

Setup to open some files in external applications might look like:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; ("\\.pdf\\'" . default) is already member in `org-file-apps'
;; Use "xdg-open" to open files by default
(setcdr (assq t org-file-apps-gnu) 'browse-url-xdg-open)

(setq telega-open-file-function 'org-open-file)
#+end_src

If you also want to open non-document messages as file using
=telega-open-file-function= consider:

=telega-open-message-as-file= - List of message types to open as file using
telega-open-file-function. Supported message types are: photo, video, audio,
video-note, voice-note, animation. Document messages are always opens as file.
(Default value: nil)

=telega-browse-url-alist= - Alist of custom url browse functions. Each element is
in form: (PREDICATE-OR-REGEX . FUNCTION). (Default value: nil)

*** Client side messages ignoring
In official telegram clients all messages in group chats are displayed even if
message has been sent by blocked sender (user or chat). telega has client side
message ignoring feature implemented. Ignoring messages can be done by adding
function into telega-msg-ignore-predicates. This function must accept single
argument - message, and return non-nil if messages should be ignored. For
example, to ignore messages from particular user with id=12345 you could add
next code:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my-telega-ignore-12345-user (msg)
  (let ((sender (telega-msg-sender msg)))
    (and (telega-user-p sender)
       (= (plist-get sender :id) 12345))))

(add-hook 'telega-msg-ignore-predicates 'my-telega-ignore-12345-user)
#+end_src

Or to ignore messages from blocked senders (users or chats), just add:

: (add-hook 'telega-msg-ignore-predicates 'telega-msg-from-blocked-sender-p)

To view recently ignored messages use M-x telega-ignored-messages RET command.
