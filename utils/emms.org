#+begin_comment
We can use the regular GNU/Emacs killing and yanking commands to move and copy
tracks in between playlist buffers.  We can use the same commands to insert
arbitrary text into the playlist buffers together with the playlist tracks. Text
which is not a track is ignored by the program and can therefore be used to
include titles and annotations within the playlist.

(lookup =info= as well)

*** Tag editor mode
<backtab> / <tab> - emms-tag-editor-prev/next-field

** Managing Playlists
Start the playlist manager with 'M-x =emms-metaplaylist-mode-go='. The playlist
manager will list the playlists and mark the current one. The following commands
are available:
- RET     #'goto-current
- .       #'center-current
- C       #'new-buffer
- D       #'kill-buffer
- <space> #'set-active
- q       #'kill-*this*-buffer

** Bookmarking (useful for podcasts and lectures)
Bookmark is just a timestamp, with your mark on it.
