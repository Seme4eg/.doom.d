#+title: Pdf-tools

??? Virtual - Use a collection of documents as if it were one, big single PDF.

/Image-mode/ keymap might also be somehow useful in pdf-mode?

=pdf-virtual-edit-mode= - for editing pdfs, but something might b wront with
encoding.

Like in *VIM*: gg/G, hjkl, nN, /?, m[arking] and jumping to marks (')
